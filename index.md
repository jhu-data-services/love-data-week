Students will turn their work into a great story using the ArcGIS StoryMaps web app.  StoryMaps allows a user to create an interactive web presence for their research materials without knowing any HTML, CSS, or Javascript.  In this hands-on session with JHU Data Services, you’ll integrate maps, text, and scanned images.  You’ll have the opportunity to share your resulting StoryMap with any group or individual you choose or keep it to yourself for later work. No previous experience required.
