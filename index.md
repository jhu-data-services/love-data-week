## What is Love Data Week?
Love Data week is an international celebration of data. This year's theme is **Data: Delivering a Better Future**

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
