## What is Love Data Week?
Love Data Week is an international celebration of data hosted by the [Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)](https://cms.icpsr.umich.edu/love-data-week-2021-international-events?utm_source=all&utm_medium=all&utm_campaign=LDW2021all). The purpose of Love Data Week is to raise awareness and build a community to engage on topics related to research data analysis, management, sharing, preservation, reuse, and library-based research data services. 

This year's theme is **Data is for everyone!** Love Data Week 2022 is all about how different folks use data. This year we're focused on the people side of data. What does data look like in different disciplines? How about biases in data... who is "in" the data and who is invisible? 

JHU Data Services will be hosting a number of workshops and presentations along this theme. Come learn a new skill, or see what amazing research is happening at our university!

Do you want to make your scientific publications more impactful? It’s said that a picture is worth a thousand words; a well-designed scientific figure is essential in concisely and clearly communicating complex ideas to your audience. Join JHU Data Services in this workshop session, where we’ll cover design principles and recommended practices for creating effective scientific figures. There is no required prerequisite for this class, but experience preparing scientific figures would be useful.   

> **1:00 pm - 2:30 pm** [**Creating Effective Scientific Figures**]()
> 
> _[Pete Lawson, Ph.D.](https://www.library.jhu.edu/staff/peter-lawson/), Data and Visualization Librarian_

OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful free and open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it and transforming it from one format into another. Do you a have messy dataset, with missing, corrupted, misspelled, or duplicated data? This lesson will teach you to use OpenRefine to clean and format data effectively, as well as how to automate and reproduce the cleaning process. OpenRefine is an easy to use GUI tool, and does not require any programming knowledge.

### Tuesday, February 15th
> **11:00 am - 12:00 pm** [**(Virtual) Lunch and Learn - Discovering Data for Research**](https://jh.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcld--trDIvHtIbUZ_J5D6OeryCZJgvpIn9)

You are already writing comments for your Python code so you may be wondering why you need to document code with a Notebook tool, such as Jupyter Notebooks. Notebook tools help you document and share your work with fellow Python coders, non-coders or non-Python coders. This workshop will teach you the basics of using Jupyter Notebooks and will focus on the features of Jupyter Notebooks that help you create reproducible research and code for technical and non-technical audiences. Many Python users choose to document and share code with Jupyter Notebooks, but this tool can also be used with other programming languages, including Julia and R. You can find examples of Jupyter Notebooks [here](https://nbviewer.org/).

> **2:00 pm - 4:00 pm** [**Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks for Reproducible Research**](https://jh.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcld--trDIvHtIbUZ_J5D6OeryCZJgvpIn9)

### Wednesday, February 16th
> **2:00 pm - 3:15 pm:** [**Ethics in Data Visualization**]()
> 
> _[Pete Lawson, Ph.D.](https://www.library.jhu.edu/staff/peter-lawson/), Data and Visualization Librarian_
>
Good data visualizations can bring clarity to data, but visualizations can be exploited to mislead and misinform. Join JHU Data Services in this interactive workshop where we will learn how to critically evaluate a data visualization at each step of the data visualization process and learn techniques for ethics centered data visualization design. Over the course of this workshop you will practice the steps of the data visualization process, learn how decisions in the steps up to data visualization can affect the final visualization, and identify common sources of bias in the data visualization process.


### Thursday, February 17th
> **2:00 pm - 4:00 pm:** [**Protecting Human Subject Data Privacy: an Introduction**]()
>
_[Dave Fearon, Ph.D.](https://www.library.jhu.edu/staff/dave-fearon/), Senior Data Management Consultant_ 
>
Protecting research participant and patients’ privacy is challenging not just for security, but also when anonymizing data for external collaborators, publications, and research databases. Join JHU Data Services for an overview of common privacy disclosure risks from personal and health identifiers in data. We discuss how to comply with IRB and HIPAA guidance for data security within the research team and introduce techniques for de-identifying data for external collaborators and public databases. You may preview session topics in our online module and guide. 

### Friday, February 18th
> **12:00 pm - 1:00 pm** [**Lunch and Learn - Introduction to Regular Expressions**]()
>
> _[Pete Lawson, Ph.D.](https://www.library.jhu.edu/staff/peter-lawson/), Data and Visualization Librarian_

Heard about Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but don’t know how to use them? Join JHU Data Services in this one-hour presentation, as we cover a powerful tool for researchers to access and acquire data in R. This presentation will first introduce APIs and how to make API requests in R. The presentation will then demonstrate and go over several options for how to access data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s various APIs. Prior experience and knowledge of R is recommended.
