## What is Love Data Week?
Love Data Week is an international celebration of data hosted by the [Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)](https://cms.icpsr.umich.edu/love-data-week-2021-international-events?utm_source=all&utm_medium=all&utm_campaign=LDW2021all). The purpose of Love Data Week is to raise awareness and build a community to engage on topics related to research data analysis, management, sharing, preservation, reuse, and library-based research data services. 

This year's theme is **Data: Delivering a Better Future**.

In this kickoff session for Love Data Week we will introduce you to Data Services, and our offerings, in a series of lightning talks. These talks will include finding maps and learning StoryMaps with Lena Denis, ArcGIS with Bonni Widdstadt, Data Archiving with Chen Chiu, De-identification with Dave Fearon, and Data Visualization and an introduction to Love Data Week with Pete Lawson.


> **2:00 pm - 3:00 pm** [**Introduction to Data Cleaning with OpenRefine**](https://jh.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYlf-ytrTgoG9MbOZgBf5-ts_dsC8ffKww- )
> 
> _[Pete Lawson, Ph.D.](https://www.library.jhu.edu/staff/peter-lawson/), Data and Visualization Librarian_

OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful free and open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it and transforming it from one format into another. Do you a have messy dataset, with missing, corrupted, misspelled, or duplicated data? This lesson will teach you to use OpenRefine to clean and format data effectively, as well as how to automate and reproduce the cleaning process. OpenRefine is an easy to use GUI tool, and does not require any programming knowledge.

### Tuesdaay, February 9th
> **12:00 pm - 1:00 pm** [**Documenting Your Research Data**](https://jh.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwqde6oqD4qEtXAvydSH4Dkk77Qi9aET2wZ)
> 
> _[Chen Chiu, Ph.D.](https://www.library.jhu.edu/staff/chen-chiu/), Data Management Consultant_
>
Documenting your research data is a prerequisite for data sharing and your own use of your data in the future. Good documentation helps your data be discoverable, understood, and trusted by others. We will discuss the following topics in this workshop: 
_Metadata standards_ - using metadata standards will help you stay consistent in your documentation and ensures other researchers in your field can understand and re-use your data. 
_Documenting tabular data_ -  Tabular data is one of the most widely used ways to structure research data. 
_Documenting code_: Researchers often write code to acquire, manage and analyze research data. Providing good documentation for your code is important for others to understand and reuse your scripts. 

> **2:00 pm - 4:00 pm** [**Introduction to WebMapping**](https://jh.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIsc-yvpjgpHtb4654V7nkcdaQg14ktS4JD)
> 
> _[Bonnie Wittstadt, Ph.D.](https://www.library.jhu.edu/staff/bonnie-wittstadt/), GIS Librarian_
>
Attendees will learn how to search, find, and share geographic content using Johns Hopkins ArcGIS Online Organization account. This JHU Data Services class will provide the fundamental skills necessary to create, design, and share web maps, as well as use some of the various geoprocessing tools currently offered via the online application. 

### Wednesday, February 10th
> **12:00 pm - 1:00 pm:** [**Introduction to ICPSR**](https://jh.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAtduquqjovEtIV7N9rf8Zn2I0BCjaN8PLZ)

The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) provides leadership and training in data access, curation, and methods of analysis for the social science research community. This session will introduce you to the resources available to JHU affiliates through the ICPSR, including one of the world's oldest and largest social and behavioral science data archives, educational resources including the Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research, and data management plan and budget estimate support for grant proposals. Whether you are a student, faculty, or staff, there is likely something at the ICPSR for you!


> **2:00 pm - 4:00 pm:** [**Data for Studying the Quality of Elections and Democracy**](https://zoom.us/j/4124012148)
>
>*[Bryce Corrigan, Ph.D.](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/person/bryce-corrigan/), Senior Statistician and Lecturer, SNF Agora Institute*
>
Scholars of democracy have witnessed a worldwide surge in phenomena undermining it in recent years, sounding the alarm most recently over Trump and his partisans’ disinformation campaign to undermine electoral integrity and foment insurrection. In this session, I will introduce how scholars measure the quality of elections and liberal democracy and the use of several publicly available datasets. In looking at these data, we will see how they reflect (or fail to reflect) democracy as we might conceive of it, and also how they can aide us in grasping changes, fast and slow, born out of sociopolitical, economic, and technological forces.

### Thursday, February 11th
> **2:00 pm - 4:00 pm:** [**Bring Your Research Alive with StoryMaps: Beginners**](https://jhu.libcal.com/event/7498271)
>
*[Bonnie Wittstadt](https://www.library.jhu.edu/staff/bonnie-wittstadt/), GIS Librarian and [Lena Denis](https://www.library.jhu.edu/staff/lena-denis/), Geospatial Data, GIS, and Maps Librarian*
>
Students will turn their work into a great story using the ArcGIS StoryMaps web app.  StoryMaps allows a user to create an interactive web presence for their research materials without knowing any HTML, CSS, or Javascript.  In this hands-on session with JHU Data Services, you’ll integrate maps, text, and scanned images.  You’ll have the opportunity to share your resulting StoryMap with any group or individual you choose or keep it to yourself for later work. No previous experience required. 

### Friday, February 12th
> **11:00 am - 12:00 pm** [**Working with APIs and the U.S. Census in R**](https://jh.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwsdeyoqTMiE9EO3wUt554C-yk6iqnOWxuF)
>
*[Reina Murray](https://www.library.jhu.edu/staff/reina-chano-murray/), Geospatial Data Curator and Applications Administrator* 
>
Heard about Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but don’t know how to use them? Join JHU Data Services in this one-hour presentation, as we cover a powerful tool for researchers to access and acquire data in R. This presentation will first introduce APIs and how to make API requests in R. The presentation will then demonstrate and go over several options for how to access data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s various APIs. Prior experience and knowledge of R is recommended.


> **2:00 pm - 4:00 pm:** [**Bring Your Research Alive with StoryMaps: Advanced**](https://jhu.libcal.com/event/7498289)
>
*[Bonnie Wittstadt](https://www.library.jhu.edu/staff/bonnie-wittstadt/), GIS Librarian and [Lena Denis](https://www.library.jhu.edu/staff/lena-denis/), Geospatial Data, GIS, and Maps Librarian*

Prerequisite: Bringing Your Research Alive Through Story Telling: StoryMaps for Beginners or some experience using StoryMaps. Students will turn their work into a great story using the ArcGIS StoryMaps web app.  StoryMaps allows a user to create an interactive web presence for their research materials without knowing any HTML, CSS, or Javascript.  In this hands-on session with JHU Data Services, you’ll learn some advanced features for presenting your maps, text, and scanned images through express maps, a guided map tour, an explorer map tour, and a custom theme builder.  You’ll have the opportunity to share your resulting StoryMap with any group or individual you choose, including through a StoryMaps Collections showcase, or keep it to yourself for later work. Prior experience with StoryMaps, such as through our Beginner workshop, required.  There will be time at the end for questions about using StoryMaps for your own projects.
