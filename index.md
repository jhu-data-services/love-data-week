## What is Love Data Week?
Love Data week is an international celebration of data. This year's theme is **Data: Delivering a Better Future**

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

> [**Bring Your Research Alive with StoryMaps: Beginners**](https://jhu.libcal.com/event/7498271)
Students will turn their work into a great story using the ArcGIS StoryMaps web app.  StoryMaps allows a user to create an interactive web presence for their research materials without knowing any HTML, CSS, or Javascript.  In this hands-on session with JHU Data Services, you’ll integrate maps, text, and scanned images.  You’ll have the opportunity to share your resulting StoryMap with any group or individual you choose or keep it to yourself for later work. No previous experience required.
